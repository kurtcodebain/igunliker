Instagram unliking script!

## Prerequisites

2FA must be disabled!

## How To Run

Replace `???` placeholders in `igun.ts`

`npm i`

`npx ts-node igun.ts`

## Info

Instagram (API) limits the amount of commands (unlikes in this case) you can do within a certain timeframe. 

Usually you only need to reauthorize your account via the Instagram app or webpage to get going again. 

Sometimes you are being timed out and have to wait for up to 10 minutes before being able to rerun the script again.
