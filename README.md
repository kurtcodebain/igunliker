## Info

Instagram (API) imposes restrictions on the number of commands, such as unlikes, that you can execute within a specific time frame.

Possible scenarios you may encounter:
* Reauthorization of your account through the Instagram app or webpage
* Encountering a timeout, necessitating a wait of up to 10 minutes before rerunning the script
* Being fully logged out of your account, resulting in an inability to reauthorize for XX minutes
